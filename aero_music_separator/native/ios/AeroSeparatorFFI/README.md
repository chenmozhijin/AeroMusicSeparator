# AeroSeparatorFFI Pod Bundle

This directory hosts the local CocoaPods spec used by the iOS app target.

- `AeroSeparatorFFI.podspec`: pod metadata and link settings.
- `AmsFfiKeepAlive.m`: keeps FFI-exported C symbols from being stripped.
- `AeroSeparatorFFI.xcframework`: generated by:
  - `aero_music_separator/native/tools/apple/build_ios_ffi_xcframework.sh`

The XCFramework is intentionally generated during setup/build and is not
expected to be committed as a source artifact.
